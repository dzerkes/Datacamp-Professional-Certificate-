# Datacamp-Professional-Certificate-
Case study for datacamp's data scientist professional certificate

# Future Work 

- More hyperparameter tuning (use bayesian optimization)
- Use log transformation in price in case it is skewed.
- split data to train/test from the beginning. Check how the pipeline applies if test was never in Kmeans or OneHotEncoding etc..
- Avoid Data Leakage by splitting dataset to train/test before any feature engineering method applies.
- Test other gradient boosted models
- Test deep learning methods such as TabNet
